			Use logic to send a, b, c, d, depending on the pin that equals 0.  
			
			Pseudo Code: if d2 equals 0, set transmitter1_data.response equal to the character a
			
			Requirements:   Responses can only be a single character
							Responses should be all lower case	
							Responses should be set to a b c or d	
							
			Additional Tips:
				In another project, I wanted to read pin D9 to see if it was grounded out. I used     if (digitalRead(9)==0).  
				 
				To send the data to my radio, here's the code:   bool ok=radio.write(&transmitter1_data, sizeof(transmitter1_data));
				Don't change that single line or you'll see bad things.  Simply copy that line after you set all the stuff and send it over!
				
				I'd strongly recommend you use these lines to help debug your code:
				
				String test = "Table: " + String(transmitter1_data.table) + "\tTeam Name: " + String(transmitter1_data.teamName) + "\tResponse: " + String(transmitter1_data.response) + "";
				Serial.println(test);
				
				Check the struct at the top of this file to see the data I need!
